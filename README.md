# garrett-is-theme

A theme for garrett.is -- garrett.is / {{ verb }} / {{ noun }}

modified from an existing theme I wrote last year -

The idea for this project was building a semantic data storage system for my projects -- 

I've used php as the primary templating language through wordpress to accomplish this. The site is structured according to semantic principles in english, based on the garrett.is/ url

What I've done is take this initial building block and created a dynamic system which generates url's which are syntactically correct in english.
Each project name is a verb, and each project title is a noun : garrett.is / {{ verb }} / {{ noun }}

It remains wholly imperfect, but I thought the concept was interesting. Hoping to create some more complex / more interesting
sentences and sentence structures in the future.
